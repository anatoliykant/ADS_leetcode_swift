#### [56. Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

Given an array of intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

Example 1:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```

Constraints:

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 104`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= starti <= endi <= 104`
